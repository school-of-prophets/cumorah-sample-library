    this is a comment, you know that because it is a line that starts with slash star
    its just a way to explain something about the code
    it continues to be a comment until a line that ends in star slash

sub-bookcase-aka: A grouping of bookshelves within the bookcase

sub-bookcase-sum: I have no idea why you would want to do this, but its supported.
