chaper-aka: Forward, etc.
chapter-path: /cumorah-sample-library/about

sub-chapter: A Brief Explanation
. some books have multiple pre-sections before the main content
. so this shows how you could potentially do that sort of thing and collapse them all down into one top-level chapter.

sub-chapter: Acknowledgements
. you could acknowledge people here if you wanted

sub-chapter: Dedication
. this tool is dedicated to the honest believer that is willing to give and receive in sincerity.

sub-chapter: Alternatives
. just because we decided to use a single chapter for the opening meta content, doesnt mean you have to do that.  You could organize your meta content for your library into a book, volume, whatever.
